        <h1>Cathleen's Favorite Super Star</h1>
        Xiaozhan is my favorite super star so far even though I have been his fan less than a month. He attracted
        me a lot no matter singing or acting. He always takes care of his fans in various ways such as writing
        a note and creating vlogs. He acknowledges a lot to his fans, I am the one of them who have benn moved by him.
        <h2>About Him
        He born in 1991, only 6 years before me. He has been a designer before because he major in Art during college
        years. So, he is pretty good at drawing beside his cooking, singing, and acting talents. Definately, looking
        good is just the one of his innate intelligents.
