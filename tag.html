        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Cathleen, a young girl from Beijing China and also a Junior at UW. Unfortunately,
            I still wait for my major until the 5th week of the autumn quarter. Communication
            and Psychology are my intended majors. I know I have to catch up after this quarter.
            And I hope that I can make more friends after I enroll the major</p>
        <p>Normally, I would like to watch drama, movies, or reading books instead of
            doing exercise since I am a lazy girl. But I like to hand out with my best
            friends no matter how tired I am in that day</p>
