        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Cathleen, a young girl from Beijing, China, also a Junior at UW. Unfortunately,
            I still wait for my major until the 5th week of the autumn quarter. Communication
            and Psychology are my intended majors. I know I have to catch up after this quarter and I hope 
            that I can make more friends after I enroll the major.</p>
        <p>Normally, I would like to watch drama, movies, or read books instead of
            doing outside exercise since I am a kind of lazy, but I enjoy hanging out with my best
            friends no matter how tired I am that day.</p>
