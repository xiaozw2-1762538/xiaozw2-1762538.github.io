					<p>Cosmetics are substances or products used to enhance or alter the appearance of the face or fragrance and texture of the body. Many cosmetics are designed for use of applying to the face and body. They are generally mixtures of chemical compounds derived from natural sources (such as coconut oil), or may be synthetic or artificial.Cosmetics that are applied to the face to enhance one's appearance may be called makeup which include lipstick, mascara, eye shadow, foundation, blush, and bronzer, among other products.

					</p>
					<p> In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates cosmetics,defines cosmetics as "intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance without affecting the body's structure or functions". This broad definition includes any material intended for use as a ingredient of a cosmetic product. The FDA specifically excludes pure soap from this category.</p>
					<p>Cosmetics have been in use for thousands of years. The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics has led to negative side effects, deformities, blindness, and even death through the ages. Examples are the prevalent use of ceruse (white lead), to cover the face during the Renaissance, and blindness caused by the mascara Lash Lure during the early 20th century. </p>
